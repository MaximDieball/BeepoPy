# BeepoPy
An interactive way to learn coding for kids.

BeepoPy is a platform for setting up and solving coding problems in a simple 2D world. 
It can be used to teach students loops, conditions, and more, using the Python programming language.
BeepoPy is built on PyQt5 and partially designed with the QtDesigner.
The idea behind this kind of learning application comes from JavaKara. BeepoPy uses a different programming language and will have more features to surpass its outdated inspiration, JavaKara.

Example tasks and solutions can be found in the documentation.

THIS IS ONLY A SCHOOL/PERSONAL PROJECT

THE CODE IS STILL IN AN EARLY PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT
